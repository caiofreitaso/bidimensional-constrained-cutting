Bidimensional Constrained Cutting
=================================

Exact algorithm for resolution of two-dimensional constrained cutting problems.

It only reads files in the following structure:
> \[ Sheet Dimension \] \[ Sheet Dimension \] \[ Number of Patterns \]
> \[ Pattern Dimension \] \[ Pattern Dimension \] \[ Pattern Value \] \[ Pattern Maximum Quantity \]
>

It doesn't matter if you put the height or width first.
